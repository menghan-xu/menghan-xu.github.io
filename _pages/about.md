I’m a master’s student at Cornell University, where I do research in machine learning. I’m particularly interested in large language models and exploring new approaches to reasoning. I received my B.S. in Statistics from the University of Science and Technology of China.

Beyond research, I genuinely enjoy thinking and solving algorithmic problems, or more broadly, tackling complex problems that require deep reasoning. Recently, I’ve been especially interested in topics like LP duality, the hedge algorithm, and game theory.

Outside of academics, I enjoy astronomy and astrophysics. I also like listening to music, especially indie music, singing, playing the guitar, watching arthouse films, and pretty much any kind of strategic game.
